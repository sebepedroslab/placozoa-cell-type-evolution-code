Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 0.7249

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.0795         0.2500
  2         0.3750         0.2500

  4         2.6117         0.2500
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -3832715.44152874
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.00000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
