Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 0.7674

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.0886         0.2500
  2         0.3937         0.2500
  3         0.9475         0.2500
  4         2.5702         0.2500
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -1516346.215443
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
