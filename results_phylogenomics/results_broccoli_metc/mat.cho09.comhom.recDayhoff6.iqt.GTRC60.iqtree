Model of rate heterogeneity: Gamma with 4 categories
Gamma shape alpha: 0.7311

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  1         0.0808         0.2500
  2         0.3778         0.2500

  4         2.6054         0.2500
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -493369.489234
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
